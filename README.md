## Introduction

IntelCor is a web-based, AI-powered room design assistant that streamlines interior design planning by providing intelligent, automated recommendations tailored to a user's specific room layout and design preferences. The system addresses the challenge of overwhelming design choices by delivering optimized product suggestions and accurate quantity estimates. Users input necessary details, and the system utilizes a machine learning model to select suitable products from a curated dataset.

## Project Overview

IntelCor was developed in response to the difficulties users face when trying to choose the most appropriate design elements for their rooms due to the overwhelming amount of options. Targeted towards homeowners, interior designers, and retailers, the system automatically recommends the best-fitting products and estimates the required quantity based on a 2D floor plan and user inputs. Real-world applications include home renovation planning, professional interior design support, and enhanced retail experiences for hardware or furniture stores through AI integration.

## Objectives

- Develop an AI-powered assistant to address the challenge of selecting interior design elements.
- Implement features for AI-driven personalized product design recommendations.
- Test and validate the system's performance, accuracy, efficiency, and usability.

## Features

- **Room Data Input:** Upload 2D floor plans and enter room details such as size.
- **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Smart suggestions for flooring, tiles, light fixtures, and furniture.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Manage product data and monitor system activity.
- **Quantity Estimation:** Predict the number of items needed based on room size and layout.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** React.js, FastAPI, TensorFlow/Scikit-learn
- **Databases:** Appwrite
- **Authentication:** Supabase
- **Other Tools:** Git, Visual Studio Code
