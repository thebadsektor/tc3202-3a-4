## Introduction

IntelCor is a web-based, AI-powered room design assistant that streamlines interior design planning by providing intelligent, automated recommendations tailored to a user's specific room layout and design preferences. The system addresses the challenge of overwhelming design choices by delivering optimized product suggestions and accurate quantity estimates.

## Project Overview

IntellCor was developed in response to the difficulties users face when trying to choose the most appropriate design elements for their rooms due to the overwhelming amount of options. Targeted towards homeowners, interior designers, and retailers, the system automatically recommends the best-fitting products and estimates the required quantity based on a 2D floor plan and user inputs.

Real-world applications include home renovation planning, professional interior design support, and enhanced retail experiences for hardware or furniture stores through AI integration.

## Objectives

**General Objective:**

- Develop IntellCor, an AI-powered room design assistant that provides optimized product recommendations based on user inputs and room specifications.

**Specific Objectives:**

- Create a user-friendly interface for uploading floor plans and entering room details.
- Implement machine learning for product selection and quantity estimation.
- Use FastAPI to manage APIs and process data efficiently.
- Deploy the app using a scalable cloud service suitable for beginners.

## Features

- **Room Data Input:** Upload 2D floor plans and enter room details such as size.
- **AI-Powered Recommendations:** Smart suggestions for flooring, tiles, light fixtures, and furniture.
- **Admin Dashboard:** Manage product data and monitor system activity.
- **Quantity Estimation:** Predict the number of items needed based on room size and layout.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks/Libraries:** React.js, FastAPI, TensorFlow/Scikit-learn
- **Databases:** Supabase and Appwrite
- **Other Tools:** Git, Render or Heroku (for deployment)
